# CreateFineTuneRequest.BatchSize property

The batch size to use for training. The batch size is the number of training examples used to train a single forward and backward pass. By default, the batch size will be dynamically configured to be ~0.2% of the number of examples in the training set, capped at 256 - in general, we've found that larger batch sizes tend to work better for larger datasets.

```csharp
public int? BatchSize { get; set; }
```
