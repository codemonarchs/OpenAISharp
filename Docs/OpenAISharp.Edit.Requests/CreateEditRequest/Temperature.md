# CreateEditRequest.Temperature property

What sampling temperature to use. Higher values means the model will take more risks. Try 0.9 for more creative applications, and 0 (argmax sampling) for ones with a well-defined answer. We generally recommend altering this or top_p but not both.

```csharp
public double? Temperature { get; set; }
```
