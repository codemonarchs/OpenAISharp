## Public Members

| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| [CreateEditRequest](CreateEditRequest/CreateEditRequest.md)(…) | The almighty constructor. |
| [Input](CreateEditRequest/Input.md) { get; set; } | The input text to use as a starting point for the edit. |
| [Instruction](CreateEditRequest/Instruction.md) { get; } | The instruction that tells the model how to edit the prompt. |
| [Model](CreateEditRequest/Model.md) { get; } | ID of the model to use. You can use the List models API to see all of your available models, or see our Model overview for descriptions of them. |
| [N](CreateEditRequest/N.md) { get; set; } | How many edits to generate for the input and instruction. |
| [Temperature](CreateEditRequest/Temperature.md) { get; set; } | What sampling temperature to use. Higher values means the model will take more risks. Try 0.9 for more creative applications, and 0 (argmax sampling) for ones with a well-defined answer. We generally recommend altering this or top_p but not both. |
| [TopP](CreateEditRequest/TopP.md) { get; set; } | An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered. We generally recommend altering this or temperature but not both. |
