# CreateCompletionRequest.Logprobs property

Include the log probabilities on the logprobs most likely tokens, as well the chosen tokens. For example, if logprobs is 5, the API will return a list of the 5 most likely tokens. The API will always return the logprob of the sampled token, so there may be up to logprobs+1 elements in the response. The maximum value for logprobs is 5. If you need more than this, please contact us through our Help center and describe your use case.

```csharp
public int? Logprobs { get; set; }
```
