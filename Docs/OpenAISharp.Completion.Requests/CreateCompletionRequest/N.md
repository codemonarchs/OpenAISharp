# CreateCompletionRequest.N property

How many completions to generate for each prompt. Note: Because this parameter generates many completions, it can quickly consume your token quota. Use carefully and ensure that you have reasonable settings for max_tokens and stop.

```csharp
public int? N { get; set; }
```
