# CreateCompletionRequest.BestOf property

Generates best_of completions server-side and returns the "best" (the one with the highest log probability per token). Results cannot be streamed. When used with n, best_of controls the number of candidate completions and n specifies how many to return – best_of must be greater than n. Note: Because this parameter generates many completions, it can quickly consume your token quota. Use carefully and ensure that you have reasonable settings for max_tokens and stop.

```csharp
public int? BestOf { get; set; }
```
