# CreateCompletionRequest.Prompt property

The prompt(s) to generate completions for, encoded as a string, array of strings, array of tokens, or array of token arrays. Note that &lt;&#x7C;endoftext&#x7C;&gt; is the document separator that the model sees during training, so if a prompt is not specified the model will generate as if from the beginning of a new document.

```csharp
public object? Prompt { get; set; }
```
