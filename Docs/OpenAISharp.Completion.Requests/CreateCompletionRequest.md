## Public Members

| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| [CreateCompletionRequest](CreateCompletionRequest/CreateCompletionRequest.md)(…) | The almighty constructor. |
| [BestOf](CreateCompletionRequest/BestOf.md) { get; set; } | Generates best_of completions server-side and returns the "best" (the one with the highest log probability per token). Results cannot be streamed. When used with n, best_of controls the number of candidate completions and n specifies how many to return – best_of must be greater than n. Note: Because this parameter generates many completions, it can quickly consume your token quota. Use carefully and ensure that you have reasonable settings for max_tokens and stop. |
| [Echo](CreateCompletionRequest/Echo.md) { get; set; } | Echo back the prompt in addition to the completion. |
| [FrequencyPenalty](CreateCompletionRequest/FrequencyPenalty.md) { get; set; } | Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim. |
| [LogitBias](CreateCompletionRequest/LogitBias.md) { get; set; } | Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion. Accepts a json object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the GPT tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. You can use this tokenizer tool (which works for both GPT-2 and GPT-3) to convert text to token IDs. Mathematically, the bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token. As an example, you can pass {"50256": -100} to prevent the &lt;&#x7C;endoftext&#x7C;&gt; token from being generated. |
| [Logprobs](CreateCompletionRequest/Logprobs.md) { get; set; } | Include the log probabilities on the logprobs most likely tokens, as well the chosen tokens. For example, if logprobs is 5, the API will return a list of the 5 most likely tokens. The API will always return the logprob of the sampled token, so there may be up to logprobs+1 elements in the response. The maximum value for logprobs is 5. If you need more than this, please contact us through our Help center and describe your use case. |
| [MaxTokens](CreateCompletionRequest/MaxTokens.md) { get; set; } | The maximum number of tokens to generate in the completion. The token count of your prompt plus max_tokens cannot exceed the model's context length. Most models have a context length of 2048 tokens (except for the newest models, which support 4096). |
| [Model](CreateCompletionRequest/Model.md) { get; } | ID of the model to use. You can use the List models API to see all of your available models, or see our Model overview for descriptions of them. |
| [N](CreateCompletionRequest/N.md) { get; set; } | How many completions to generate for each prompt. Note: Because this parameter generates many completions, it can quickly consume your token quota. Use carefully and ensure that you have reasonable settings for max_tokens and stop. |
| [PresencePenalty](CreateCompletionRequest/PresencePenalty.md) { get; set; } | Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to talk about new topics. |
| [Prompt](CreateCompletionRequest/Prompt.md) { get; set; } | The prompt(s) to generate completions for, encoded as a string, array of strings, array of tokens, or array of token arrays. Note that &lt;&#x7C;endoftext&#x7C;&gt; is the document separator that the model sees during training, so if a prompt is not specified the model will generate as if from the beginning of a new document. |
| [Stop](CreateCompletionRequest/Stop.md) { get; set; } | Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens. The returned text will not contain the stop sequence. |
| [Stream](CreateCompletionRequest/Stream.md) { get; set; } | Whether to stream back partial progress. If set, tokens will be sent as data-only server-sent events as they become available, with the stream terminated by a data: [DONE] message. |
| [Suffix](CreateCompletionRequest/Suffix.md) { get; set; } | The suffix that comes after a completion of inserted text. |
| [Temperature](CreateCompletionRequest/Temperature.md) { get; set; } | What sampling temperature to use. Higher values means the model will take more risks. Try 0.9 for more creative applications, and 0 (argmax sampling) for ones with a well-defined answer. We generally recommend altering this or top_p but not both. |
| [TopP](CreateCompletionRequest/TopP.md) { get; set; } | An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered. We generally recommend altering this or temperature but not both. |
| [User](CreateCompletionRequest/User.md) { get; set; } | A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to monitor and detect abuse. |
